## Keyboard Shortcuts

Open **Keybindings** from the bottom of the left navigation rail to view available keyboard shortcuts. In collapsed mode, hover the keyboard icon to see the label tooltip.

## Logs and Debugging

The platform emits structured JSON audit logs for auditing and debugging:

- **Backend / Simulator:** Logs go to stdout. With Docker: `docker compose logs backend` or `docker compose logs simulator`. Each line is JSON with `audit: true`, `action`, `component`, and action-specific fields.
- **Frontend:** In development, user actions (simulator, watchlist, ack/resolve, search) are logged to the browser console. In production, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDIT_LOG=true` to enable.

## Operator Mode

For mission control environments, the platform supports:

- **High-contrast mode** — higher contrast for visibility
- **Large-type mode** — larger text for readability

Use **Screen type** in the bottom utility section of the left navigation rail to switch modes. Preferences are stored in the browser.
