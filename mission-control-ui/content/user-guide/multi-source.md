# Multi-Source Operations

**Workflow:** Multiple telemetry streams -> switch context

The platform supports multiple telemetry sources and simulators. A **source** is one row in the source list. Each source can have multiple **streams** (one ingest session). A stream belongs to exactly one source. Catalog metadata, watchlists, and realtime routing are keyed by `source_id`; live telemetry samples are keyed by `stream_id`. `vehicle_id` remains on simulator controls and position/orbit surfaces where it refers to the operator-facing spacecraft identity.

## Source Selector

In the **Context Banner** on the Overview and Telemetry Detail pages, you switch between logical sources only. The dropdown lists registered sources, not individual streams. Telemetry Detail URLs stay source-first: `/telemetry/{source_id}/{channel_name}`. **Edit scope** in the channel header sets whether Summary, Analysis, History, Explanation, and Events use the latest stream, selected streams, selected streams with time bounds, or all channel data in a date range.

Because channel catalogs are now source-scoped, a channel detail page is only valid for sources that actually expose that channel. Registered channels still open even before any samples arrive; the page shows **No data** and empty chart/history states until telemetry is ingested. If you switch to a source that does not provide the current channel, the app redirects you back to that source’s Overview with a notice instead of leaving you on a 404 page.

## Per-Source Feed Health

Each source has its own feed status:

- **Live** — receiving data within ~15 seconds
- **Degraded** — no recent data for 15–60 seconds
- **No data** — no data for 60+ seconds

The banner shows the status for the currently selected source.

## Event History Filtered by Source

The **Overview** page shows ops events for the selected source directly under the Event Console. The historical event browser follows the source selected in the Context Banner and supports event-type and time-range filtering.

## When to Use Multi-Source

- **Multiple sources** — monitor several spacecraft or ingest producers from one dashboard
- **Multiple simulators** — run several simulator instances (e.g. for testing or demos)
- **Test vs prod** — compare simulator vs live ingest

## Adding a Simulator

1. Go to the **Sources** page.
2. Click **Add source**.
3. Choose **Simulator**.
4. Enter a name, a **Vehicle configuration path** (JSON or YAML under the Layer 2 vehicle configuration resources), and a **Base URL** — the URL the server uses to reach the managed simulator, typically a control-plane runtime proxy URL.
5. Click **Create**.

The simulator appears in the Simulators list. The backend seeds its expected channel catalog immediately from the vehicle configuration file. Click **Manage** to open its control panel and start, pause, or stop it.

## Adding a Vehicle

1. Go to the **Sources** page.
2. Click **Add source**.
3. Choose **Vehicle**.
4. Enter a name and a **Vehicle configuration path**.
5. Click **Create**.

The backend seeds the source catalog from that definition so searches, watchlists, summaries, and alerts know which channels belong to that source before live ingest starts.

## Simulator streams (fresh slate per start)

Each time you **start** a simulator from the Sources page, the platform creates a new stream for that source. You are taken to the **Overview** with that source selected; the Overview and Telemetry Detail then show data for the source's current stream. History, trends, and exports remain stream-scoped, while the page URL stays at the source level.

## Local Config-Backed Sources

The local stack includes ordinary vehicle and simulator configuration files under Layer 2 resources:

- `Aegon Relay` and `Balerion Surveyor` as vehicle source examples
- `DrogonSat` as a lighter simulator example that emits GPS/LLA position channels
- `RhaegalSat` as a heavier simulator example that emits ECEF position channels

These are not privileged backend identities. If the configuration files are removed, the sources do not auto-register. `DrogonSat` and `RhaegalSat` intentionally share only a small common core. `RhaegalSat` has more onboard computer temperature/load channels, a split propulsion system, and a larger payload/comms catalog, so source switching exercises real source-specific workflows instead of identical feeds with different names.
