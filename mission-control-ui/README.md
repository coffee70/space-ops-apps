## Telemetry Operations Frontend

This package contains the **Next.js dashboard** for the Telemetry Operations Platform. It provides mission operators with:

- **Overview dashboard** for watchlists, anomalies, and live status
- **Overview-integrated semantic search** and **channel detail** pages with trends, z-scores, and AI explanations
- **Simulator controls** and other workflows that sit on top of the backend telemetry API

For an end-to-end description of what the full application does, see the root `README.md` and the user guide in `frontend/content/user-guide`.

## Running the frontend in development

From the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

By default the app expects the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`. You can override this with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.

**Docker:** that value is read at **`next build`** time in the image. To point the browser at a different API host (e.g. LAN IP), rebuild the frontend image with a build arg — see the troubleshooting note in the root `README.md` after “Start services”.

> When running the full stack with Docker, prefer the root-level instructions in `../README.md`, which start all services (database, backend, frontend, simulator) together.

## Browser Validation

Use the shared Playwright workspace at `../tools/playwright` for browser testing and smoke checks instead of creating a frontend-local or `.cursor` Playwright install.

Application loader entries are generated. Use `npm run check:application-loaders` to verify the committed manifest is current, and `npm run generate:application-loaders` to refresh it.

From the workspace root:

```bash
./space-ops-kernel/scripts/validate-playwright.sh smoke
```
